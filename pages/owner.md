# Author of the Site

This site was created by Wayne Hastings, an Indiana University graduate student who is currently in his first years as a Masters Library Science student. Hastings has professional work experience in archival work, having worked at the Monroe County History Center, Cook Historic Archive, and the IU Archive of Traditional Music. One of the reasons Hastings created this site was to give users an oppritunity to appreciate Hoagy Carmichael's lesser known works, as well as his continued skill as a performer and songwriter.
