## Born in Bloomington
Although California was ultimately where Hoagy Carmichael lived out the majority of his career, Carmichael continued to distinguish himself as a Hoosier singer-songwriter. Born in 1899 in Bloomington, Indiana, Carmichael’s musical upbringing was largely contingent on his surroundings in the Hoosier state. His brief time in Indianapolis resulted in him learning from veteran Indiana Avenue bandleader, Reginald DuValle, and the proximity of Bloomington’s college campus as a jazz venue gave a young Carmichael opportunities to befriend up-and-coming jazz musicians, such as Bix Biederbecke. Although influenced by his surroundings, it would not be until the midpoint of his career that Carmichael would intentionally begin harkening back to his home state.
## Can't Get Indiana Off My Mind
Can’t Get Indiana Off My Mind, a song created in celebration of Indiana’s state song, published in 1940, and Chimes of Indiana, Carmichaels’ 1954 tribute to his alma mater, are well known contributions in honor of his home state. Lesser known pieces such as Brown County In Autumn, published in 1949, and Ain’t God Good to Indiana, published in 1946, further encouraged listeners to conceptualize Carmichael as a Hoosier artist. Brown County in Autumn debuted in Indianapolis by the Indianapolis Symphony and was created for the centennial of James Whitchomb Riley, the Hoosier Poet. It was a tone poem and was a great deviation from his jazz and popular songs. As Carmichael was making a statement about himself as a songwriter, he was also choosing to celebrate himself as a Hoosier artist by paying homage to childhood memories visiting Brown County, Indiana. His musical score for the famous William Herschell poem, Ain’t God Good to Indiana, interestingly ties himself to other famous Hoosiers. These are both distinct efforts to associate himself with the state of Indiana.

## Second Half of Career Projects

Carmichael continued to participate in projects related to Indiana throughout the second half of his career. Although never published, Carmichael was commissioned to record a theme song for the Coronation Queen Waltz, an annual event held in Indianapolis. This project indicates an interest in remaining loyal to listeners from his home state. Carmichael’s painting of the Constitution Elm in Corydon, Indiana also represents his personal and non-commercial interest in his state. Considering he painted the five foot by seven foot canvas over the span of three years, Indiana seemed to remain important in his later years.

> "Most all of the painting was done little by little on summer
vacations...I would paint a bit one day, change things a bit
another day, play golf and go to the races...So you might say it
took me three years (to complete the painting)" says Carmichael
in explanation. "Oh yes, about the leaves. There are no leaves
although it is August...I think the trunk and the naked majestic
branches of such a famous tree should be seen to give the viewer
striking display of greatness and a knowledge of what age
has done to its formation."

Ultimately, before his death in 1981, Carmichael requested to be buried next to his family in Rose Hill Cemetery in Bloomington, Indiana, thus making his final resting place a tribute to his home state.
