## Earliest Works
Hoagy Carmichael is largely known for his famous melodies, but rarely for his lyrics. For much of his career, he partnered with one of the music industry’s most successful lyricists, Johnny Mercer. Together they co-created Carmichael’s most famous songs - Lazybones (1933), Skylark (1942), and In the Cool Cool Evening (1951). While there were instances where Carmichael showed talent as a lyricist, as in Lazy River (1931) and Washboard Blues (1925), he rarely composed his own lyrics.
Here his lyrics poetically evoke images of people intricately linked with the land, pleasantly in Lazy River and begrudgingly so in Washboard Blues. Although Carmichael did not enjoy writing lyrics, he had a natural talent for creating poetic descriptions that are both folksy and whimsical.
## Remembrance
His private collection of recordings and sheet music reveal great experimentation and confidence as a lyricist in the second half of his career. He composed popular music lyrics, as heard in They Can See Your Name In My Eyes (1958), and experimented with themes of remembrance and wistfulness in both There Goes Another Pal (1963) and Serenade to Gabriel (1957). 
## Storytelling
Most impressively, Carmichael adopted imaginative storytelling in his lyrics. The Monkey Song (1952) and Hong Kong Blues (1939) are innovative compositions that use narration as the nucleus of the song. Under the Monkey Pod Tree reveals creative world building that blends elements from Caribbean and Pacific Island culture to tell a quaint love story. Although problematic in its depiction of island cultures, it demonstrates creative storytelling in the later half of Carmicael’s career. Ultimately, the Second Half of Hoagy Collection displays how Carmichael generally developed as a lyricist and was willing to experiment with different types of storytelling.
