# Who Owns the Objects in the Collection?

![atm](/atm.jpg)

The IU Archive of Traditional Music officially owns all of the materials featured in this collection. The Hoagy Carmichael Collection at the Archives of Traditional Music holds over 3,500 items related to Carmichael, making it the largest collection of Hoagy Carmichael materials in the world. Users are encouraged to use the Hoagy Carmichael Collection in conjunction with the Second Half of Hoagy Collection for further exploration of personal photographs, music sheet drafts, and song catalogs.

# Metadata Standards
## Controlled Vocabularies
I followed best practices and standards in constructing my metadata fields. First, it was critical to implement controlled vocabularies to ensure usability between the IU Archive of Traditional Music’s Hoagy Carmichael Collection and the Second Half of Hoagy Collection. For instance, I followed the Archive of Traditional Music’s accession number system so that users could easily locate objects from my collection at the Hoagy Carmichael Collection. Unfortunately, this was only implemented with the recordings, since the lyric sheets were not given accession numbers by the Archive of Traditional Music. In the future, I anticipate meeting with the Archive of Traditional Music, so as to discuss appropriate accession numbers for the lyric sheets, so as to improve usability. Furthermore, song titles and dates followed the same format used by the Hoagy Carmichael Collection, so song titles such as Stardust or Star Dust would not be confused.
## Recording Standards
I followed best recording practices as I converted the analog audio into digital audio recordings. All of the recordings within the collection are at similar volumes, each ranging between -10db and -20bd, meaning there is zero distortion. The audio files also follow appropriate naming conventions, such as using all lowercase letters and zero spaces. All of the recordings were exported using at least 16-bit digital audio.
## Limitations of JPEG Files
There are major limitations regarding the quality of the JPEG files for the lyric sheets. Currently, the lyric sheets have limited usability due to blurriness. All of the lyrics sheets were exported from the Hoagy Carmichael Collection through image downloads, and not digitally scanned because the materials were not physically available due to storage changes at the Archive of Traditional Music. In the future, I plan on digitally scanning the files so the usability of the lyric sheets will be improved.
