Welcome to the Second Half of Hoagy Collection! Included here are private recordings and lyric sheets straight from Hoagy Carmichael’s personal collection during the second half of his career. Listen to never released recordings for unpublished projects and musical ideas for songs never heard by the public.
## Why is this collection important?
Hoagy Carmichael stands as one of the most influential and famous American songwriters from this past century. With the exception of a select number of works, Carmichael cemented his status as a respected American songwriter during the first half of his career, dating from the late 1920s to the early 1950s. The popularization of the rock n’ roll and hippie counterculture meant fewer and fewer opportunities for the contributors of the Great American Songbook. Nevertheless, many of these artists, including Carmichael, continued to write and record, although much of it was never released to the public.
The Second Half of Hoagy Collection presents a unique opportunity to examine Hoagy Carmichael as a mature singer-songwriter. During the 1960s and 70s, Carmichael demonstrated his improved confidence as a performer, especially as a popular music vocalist. Furthermore, he showcased his skills as a lyricist, which he rarely experimented with during the height of his career. These intimate glimpses into Hoagy Carmichael’s music workshop will ultimately result in a newfound appreciation for Carmichael and his career as a whole.
